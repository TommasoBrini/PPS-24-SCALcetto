# Docs
You can see the live doc pushed in develop directly in the link in the about section. 

You can run locally the docs:
- install jekyll => if you have linux you should have wsl installed
- run the following commands in the shell in the `docs/` directory
``` bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
